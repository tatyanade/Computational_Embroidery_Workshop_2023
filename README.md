## Intro :wave::smile:
Welcome to the Studio for Creative Inquiries **Computational Embroidery Workshop of 2023**! The goal of this workshop is to introduce the concepts and tools of computational embroidery as well as present enough compelling examples that you'll be excited to make some unique embroidered artifacts by the end of the day. To that end we'll begin the day explaining the **tools** of computational embroidery, then we'll walk through numerous **examples and artists talks**, then finally we'll give a work through some functional examples and then **work time**.

This workshop is lead by David Perry & Tatyana Mustakos, both of whom were have worked with and created custom tools with PEmbroider.

## The Tools - Intro to Machines and PEmbroider
### What is a Sewing Machine?
![Sewing Cat Gif](https://media.tenor.com/n-9i38BYM-EAAAAM/costura-swing.gif)

###### *Click [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTAdaZe6wcDj0Bdsu92sa7bdMMFb0F99oHa8dLMGpH5MlVAOQsQtwssvYYpROB5wzAfOXuxg8wqC0Gc/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=15000) for slide deck*

Here discuss a lil' bit of the history and inner workings of sewing machines. Then we'll discuss how embroidery move fabric under the needle, during stitching, to create an image or design.


### What is PEmbroider
###### *Click [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTvHAkeKiNmpaEclSHen1-ROau-8CIkmksxLbkOZCaBrQ9BSF6G7DD-NdhMurh_-6aqw1FikYbM9SCa/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000) for slide deck*

### Getting Set Up

Processing and PEmbroider should be installed before the workshop following the [event page](https://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/events/computational-embroidery-workshop) instructions, but we will be taking a moment to go through the installation and assist with setup

##### Links to Download

 1. Install Processing [HERE](https://processing.org/download)
 2. Install PEmbroider [HERE](https://github.com/CreativeInquiry/PEmbroider#tldr)

##### How to Install

  1. [Installing Processing and PEmbroider](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRRvHZRXIBePEvfNOJps9N09HPVgnTRHcnVxAtIf0SRiQX-ZLimC-N8CHJ2XppZWlxxs4hwkUb9PLic/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=30000)


### PEmbroider Demo
*This section is an in person live demonstration *
<!--  Live Demo of generative faces-->

#### Demo 1 - Basic Shapes using the Template File
###### *click [HERE](https://github.com/tatyanade/PEmbroider_Demo/blob/main/Files/PEmbroider_Template/PEmbroider_Template.pde) for the template file*

This demonstration will walk you through the PEmbroider template file and show how to create some simple shapes

#### Demo 2 - Freehand Draw
###### *click [HERE](https://github.com/CreativeInquiry/PEmbroider/blob/master/examples/PEmbroider_interactive_demo_2/PEmbroider_interactive_demo_2.pde) for the template file*

This demonstration will walk you through using the example/interactive_demo_2, which lets you draw embrioderies with your cursor

A more robust version of this sketch exists at [examples/PEmbroider_editor](https://github.com/CreativeInquiry/PEmbroider/blob/master/examples/PEmbroider_Editor/PEmbroider_Editor.pde)

##### Demo - Generative Faces: This ddemo is not covered during workshop, but is a quick demo on making generative faces

###### PEmbroider Demo](https://github.com/tatyanade/PEmbroider_Demo/blob/main/README.md)

###### [Code](https://github.com/tatyanade/PEmbroider_Demo/blob/main/Files/Generative_Faces/Generative_Faces.pde)

### How to Use the Machine

###### *Click [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQVq65vxieUifnK--Cz89FvC3j3btl6008KHzywgw5TtX3Pc2qGqh7uq2OmRntF-iHUWrgH4VbgR600/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) for slide deck*

We'll walk through the basic steps of running a design on the machine as enumerated in the following list.
1. Generate file
2. Hooping Fabric
3. Transfering file to machine
4. Using embroidery machine interface (Huskavarna & Brother + Industrial Machine)
5. Running your file!
